The code in this branch is a prototype of Narwhal HotStuff (Hotstuff-over-Narwhal). It supplements the paper [Narwhal and Tusk: A DAG-based Mempool and Efficient BFT Consensus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827.pdf) enabling reproducible results. There are no plans to maintain this branch. The [master branch](https://github.com/asonnino/narwhal) contains the most recent and polished version of this codebase.
